# Build up Nepal

The goal of this project is to analyze the data provided by **Build Up Nepal** to enable them communicate their impact to *stakeholders, communities and the government* in Nepal.
The visualization would also serve to start the conversation about safe, hygenic housing in rural areas and the importance of defining the last mile infrastructure in development planning.

The important metrics they would like to highlight include:

- Jobs created
- Houses built
- Number of enterprises established and sustaining long-term
- Tonnes of CO2 emissions saved

## Progress

- [X] Basic exploration using LibreOffice
- [X] Identified the questions I would like to answer based on the initial exploration:
  - Tonnes of CO2 emissions saved
  - Number of jobs created in each region
  - How long on average do projects last?
  - Is there a relationship between job and gender?
  - In what region are projects most abandonned? Completed?
- [ ] Start exploring the questions.
  - [X] Tonnes of CO2 saved
    Created a pivot table for district, province and CO2 emission.
    Found out:
    - The projects were able to span over **293** districts and **44854.24** Tonnes of CO2 saved.
    - Gorkha district in Gandaki Province had **18** projects and saved **5570.8974** tonnes of CO2.
